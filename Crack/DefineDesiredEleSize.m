%%
% Define desired sizes of elements or specify which elements to refine.

% 
% Only used in combination with adaptive meshing.
%
% Allows user to set desired ele sizes (EleSize) at given locations (x,y).
%
% On input EleSizeDesired are desired ele sizes at (x,y) as
% calculated by Úa based on some user-defined criteria.
%
% On output EleSizeDesired are desired ele sizes at (x,y).
%
% Do not modify the size of the (nodal) vector `EleSizeDesired' or the logical (element)
% vector 'ElementsToBeRefine', only the values.
%
% x,y are the locations where new element sizes are specifed.
%
% ElementsToBeRefined can either be a logical array in which case values set to true/1 indicate elements
% to be refined, or a list of numbers of elements to be refined.
